The conflation algorithm is a key technique in natural language processing that simplifies the analysis of textual data by reducing lexical variation. Its main function is to group different forms of a word—such as "connect," "connected," and "connecting"—into a single base or stem form. This process enables more effective information retrieval by ensuring that variations of a term don’t fragment search results or analysis. Conflation typically occurs through two main methods: stemming and lemmatization. Stemming uses rule-based algorithms to trim word endings, often producing non-dictionary words; a famous example is the Porter Stemmer. Lemmatization is more context-aware, relying on linguistic databases and part-of-speech tagging to return accurate dictionary forms, such as mapping "better" to "good." These techniques support systems like search engines and content analyzers by matching user queries with relevant documents more reliably. While stemmers like Lovins, Porter, and Snowball prioritize speed and simplicity, lemmatizers focus on precision and context. In modern applications, conflation plays a vital role in refining user experience, enhancing machine learning models, and making sense of large, varied linguistic data.

conflation algorithm key technique natural language processing that simplifies analysis textual data reducing lexical variation its main function group different forms word such as connect connected connecting into single base or stem form this process enables more effective information retrieval ensuring that variations term don t fragment search results or analysis conflation typically occurs through two main methods stemming lemmatization stemming uses rule based algorithms trim word endings often producing non dictionary words famous example porter stemmer lemmatization more context aware relying linguistic databases part speech tagging return accurate dictionary forms such as mapping better good these techniques support systems like search engines content analyzers matching user queries relevant documents more reliably while stemmers like lovins porter snowball prioritize speed simplicity lemmatizers focus precision context modern applications conflation plays vital role refining user experience enhancing machine learning models making sense large varied linguistic data
